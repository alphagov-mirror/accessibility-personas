Setting up personas on Chromebooks
==================================

When youâ€™re setting up a profile you only do each action once, unless it explicitly states to do it once per device.


Change settings for all personas
--------------------------------

Remove everything from the shelf/dock except Chrome.

Select the following options from the system menu. Go to:

* Settings > Advanced > Accessibility > Always show accessibility options in the system menu
* Settings > Device > Power > When idle > Keep display on (once per device)
* Settings > Device > Power > Sleep when lid is closed > off (once per device)
* Settings > People > Manage other people > Restrict sign-in to the following users... (once per device, can only be done by the owner account once every profile has logged in)
* Settings > enable Appearance: Show Home button > Enter custom web address: https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/[persona]/
* Settings > On start-up > Open a specific page or set of pages > Add a new page > https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-personas/[persona]/ (Note that the settings are retained, but the pages only open during system start-up.)
