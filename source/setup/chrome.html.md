# Setting up personas in Chrome

Follow the instructions on [setting up personas on Chromebooks](chromebook.html). Whenever a feature is not available in the Chrome browser, follow the instructions below.


## Claudia

Instead of using High Contrast mode, install the [High Contrast extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph)

Instead of using the magnifier, zoom in via Settings > Appearance > Page zoom: select "400%" (once per device)

Note: This will be a different experience than using the magnifier and the training tasks will not make sense with this setup


## Ashleigh

Instead of using the ChromeVox version that comes with Chromebooks, install the [ChromeVox extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn)

Note: This will have different shortcuts than the Chromebook version, for example, instead of 'Search + Arrow Right/Left' to read the next/previous text, use 'Shift + Alt + Arrow Right/Left' on Windwos and 'Cmd + Ctrl + Arrow Right/Left' on Mac


## Simone

Instead of using Select-to-Speak and the nOverlay extension, install the [ClaroRead extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/claroread-chrome/ifgehbglgmidafhhdcopacejknmcmhcd)

Go to the settings and untick "Click and play", switch to the "Overlay" tab and tick "coloured overlay" as well as choose some light yellow as the "Overlay Colour"

Note: Let text be read out by just selecting the text, no need to press 'Search + S'
