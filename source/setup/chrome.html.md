# Setting up personas in Chrome

Follow the instructions on [setting up personas on Chromebooks](chromebook.html). Whenever a Chrome OS feature is not available on the Chrome browser, follow these instructions instead. Or skip it if there is no equivalent.


## Claudia

Instead of using High Contrast mode, install the [High Contrast extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph)

Instead of using the magnifier, zoom in via Settings > Appearance > Page zoom: select "400%" (once per device)

Note: This will be a different experience than using the magnifier and the training tasks will not make sense with this setup


## Ashleigh

Instead of using the ChromeVox version that comes with Chrome OS, install the [ChromeVox extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn)

Note: This will have different shortcuts than the Chrome OS version, for example, instead of "Search + Arrow Right/Left" to read the next/previous text, use "Shift + Alt + Arrow Right/Left" on Windwos and "Cmd + Ctrl + Arrow Right/Left" on Mac


## Christopher

Instead of disabling the touchpad, install the [Stylus extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and open [remove-cursor.user.css](raw_assets/remove-cursor.user.css) in the browser; when Stylus opens, click the "Install style" button (once per device)


## Simone

Instead of using Select-to-Speak and the nOverlay extension, install the [ClaroRead extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/claroread-chrome/ifgehbglgmidafhhdcopacejknmcmhcd)

Go to the settings and untick "Click and play", switch to the "Overlay" tab and tick "coloured overlay" as well as choose some light yellow as the "Overlay Colour"

Note: Let text be read out by just selecting the text, no need to press Search + S
