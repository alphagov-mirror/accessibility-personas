## Chromebooks

Using [personas on Chromebooks](chromebook.html) is the most effective setup we found so far.


## Chrome browsers

Alternatively, you can also set up [personas in Chrome browsers](chrome.html) on any operating system. But some of the tools will not be as effective as on Chromebooks.
