# Experience the web as personas with access needs

This is for anyone who wants to gain more understanding of accessibility issues.

The GDS Accessibility team has created 7 different accessibility personas. Each persona has different access needs.
You can [set up a device or browser](setup/) so that each persona has their own profile.
Each profile has a different simulation of their persona's condition and the assistive technology they use to help them.

When using these profiles you can:

* experience the web from the perspective of these personas
* do some short training tasks for each persona

The 7 personas are:

* [Claudia](claudia/) -- a sight impaired screen magnifier user
* [Ashleigh](ashleigh/) -- a severely sight impaired screenreader user
* [Ron](ron/) -- an older user with multiple conditions
* [Chris](chris/) -- a user with rheumatoid arthritis
* [Pawel](pawel/) -- a user with Asperger's
* [Simone](simone/) -- a dyslexic user
* [Saleem](saleem/) -- a profoundly deaf user


## Caveats

This is no substitute for including users with access needs into your user testing.

A simulation is never a true representation of an impairment. It's only a tool trying to make some things roughly as difficult for someone without that impairment.

The assistive technologies in this setup, especially the screen reader and voice control tool, are not appropriate for compatibility testing. Use [mainstream tools](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) for that.
