# Experience the web as personas with access needs

We have 7 different accessibility personas. Each persona has different access needs.
You can [set up Chromebooks](/setup.html) so that each persona has a different profile on them.
Each profile has a different simulation of their personaâ€™s condition and uses their tool(s).

When using those profiles, you can experience the web generally from the perspective of these personas.
Or you can do some specific quick training tasks we prepared on each persona's page:

* [Claudia](/claudia/) is a sight impaired screen magnifier user
* [Ashleigh](/ashleigh/) is a severely sight impaired screenreader user
* [Ron](/ron/) is an older user with multiple conditions
* [Christopher](/christopher/) is a user with rheumatoid arthritis
* [Pawel](/pawel/) is a user with Asperger's
* [Simone](/simone/) is a dyslexic user
* [Saleem](/saleem/) is a profoundly deaf user

Caveat: This is no substitute for including users with access needs into your user testing.
