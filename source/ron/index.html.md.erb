## Chromebook help

As Ron is not very technical, don't use anything which might help. For example, don't zoom into the page and don't use the keyboard to navigate.


## Training tasks

Do the following tasks first on the page with problems and then on the page which fixed the problems.

1. Find out how many Cabinet ministers there are
2. Go to the second page (see pagination at the bottom)
