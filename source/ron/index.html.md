## Chromebook help

As Ron is not very technical, don't use anything which might help. For example, don't zoom into the page and don't use the keyboard to navigate.


## Training tasks

There are 2 versions of an example page. Version 1 shows the issues Ron experiences and version 2 shows the fixes that will help Ron. Do version 1 before version 2.

Do the following tasks logged in as Ron:

1. Find out the number of Cabinet ministers.
2. Go to the second page (see pagination at the bottom).

[Version 1 - issues for Ron](bad.html)

[Version 2 - fixes for Ron](good.html)
