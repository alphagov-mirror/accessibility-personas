## About the persona

* 53 year old management accountant

* rheumatoid arthritis

* uses keyboard only, no mouse and just started using voice control

More about the [persona on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis) and [how to set it up](../setup/chromebook.html#chris)


## Chromebook help

Navigate with the tab key. Navigate back with 'Shift + Tab'.
If you're stuck, use the touchscreen. 'Ctrl + Alt + /' shows keyboard shortcuts.

Start using voice control (only in the browser) by saying "wake up". Other commands: "click" (and then follow the on-screen instructions, often saying a number), "scroll down", "scroll up", "help".
If it doesnâ€™t work, restart the extension.


## Training tasks

There are 2 versions of an example page. Version 1 shows the issues Chris experiences and version 2 shows the fixes that will help Chris. Do version 1 before version 2.

Do the following tasks logged in as Chris:

1. There is a table. Its country column includes an explanation indicated by a question mark. Try to select that question mark to find out what the explanation is.
2. The end date column might be hidden. Try to find out what the end date of the Algeria entry is.
