<div><img src="../images/persona-avatars/chris.png" class="profile" alt="" /></div>


## About the persona

* 53 years old management accountant

* Rheumatoid arthritis

* Uses keyboard only, no mouse and just started using voice control

More about the [persona on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis) and [how to set it up](../setup/chromebook.html#chris)


## Chromebook help

If you're stuck, use the touchscreen. 'Ctrl + Alt + /' shows keyboard shortcuts.

Start using voice control (only in the browser) by saying "wake up". Other commands: "click" (and then follow the on-screen instructions, often saying a number), "scroll down", "scroll up", "help".


## Training tasks

Do the following tasks logged in as Chris first on the page with issues and then on the page with fixes. Hint: Navigate with the tab key.

1. What is the explanation behind the question mark in the 'country' column?
2. What is the end date of the Algeria entry?
