More about the [persona on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis) and [how to set it up](/setup.html#christopher)


## Chromebook help

If you're stuck, use the touchscreen. 'Ctrl + Alt + /' shows keyboard shortcuts.

Start using voice control (only in the browser) by saying "wake up". Other commands: "click" (and then follow the on-screen instructions, often saying a number), "scroll down", "scroll up", "help".


## Training tasks

Do the following tasks first on the page with problems and then on the page which fixed the problems. Hint: Navigate with the tab key.

1. Skip over the long list of items in the header by using the "skip to main content" link which appears as the first tabbable element on the page.
2. What is the explanation behind the question mark in the 'country' column?
3. What is the end date of the Algeria entry?
