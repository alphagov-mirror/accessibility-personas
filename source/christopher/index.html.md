## About the persona

* 53 years old management accountant

* Rheumatoid arthritis

* Uses keyboard only, no mouse and just started using voice control

More about the [persona on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles/christopher-user-with-rheumatoid-arthritis) and [how to set it up](../setup.html#christopher)


## Chromebook help

If you're stuck, use the touchscreen. 'Ctrl + Alt + /' shows keyboard shortcuts.

Start using voice control (only in the browser) by saying "wake up". Other commands: "click" (and then follow the on-screen instructions, often saying a number), "scroll down", "scroll up", "help".
